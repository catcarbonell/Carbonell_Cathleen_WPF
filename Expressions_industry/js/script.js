// Find the percentage of how much a fixed-size container in a layout will take up in a certain resolution screen or browser.

// First, we will need to find the width of the fixed-size container
var containerwidth = prompt("What is the pixel width of your container?");

// Next, we will need the height
var containerheight = prompt("What is its height?");

// Of course, we will need the area of both:
var container = containerwidth * containerheight;

// Next, we should find out the resolution of their viewing method (browser, screen-- doesn't matter. We just need the resolution of it)
var reswidth = prompt("What is your resolution width?");
